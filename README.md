contributions you'd like to submit, either open a pull request or create a post
on the subreddit. The steps below are only needed if you want to write code for

### Getting started with development on OS X / Linux

Getting start is easy. Just clone the repository and run `make run`.

### Getting started with development on Windows

First, download and install [Github for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)
which will setup git on your computer. You'll also need PowerShell, which comes
pre-installed on Windows 7 & 8.

`https://github.com/hawkthorne/hawkthorne-journey` and click the `Fork` button

After you've successfully forked the repository go to
`https://github.com/<your username>/hawkthorne-journey` and click the "Clone in
Windows" button.

Once you have the repo, click on it in Github for Windows, select "tools > open a shell here".

In your new PowerShell window, run

```powershell
> .\make.ps1 run
```
