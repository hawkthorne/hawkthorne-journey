# Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey)

This 2d platformer is based on Community's [Digital Estate Planning][estate]
episode. It's built using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game engine. Please
[report any issues or bugs][githubissues] you have with the game!

## Downloads ( play the game )
 
- [OS X][osx]
- [Windows 32-bit][win32]
- [Windows 64-bit][win64]

If you already have love installed, you can download the
[hawkthorne.love][love] file and run the game from there.

Linux users: Install [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). You'll need at least version
0.8.0.  (Standard Ubuntu packages are too old.) After installing LÖVE, download
the [.love file][love] and run it. Everyone gets to play!

## Development ( contribute to the game )

All discussion and development takes place on
[/r/hawkthorne](http://www.reddit.com/r/hawkthorne). If you have any
contributions you'd like to submit, either open a pull request or create a post
on the subreddit.

You'll need to have git installed before you'll be able to start development

### Getting started

1. Set up Git on your machine - https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
2. Type the following commands in a terminal window to run the game

    git clone git://github.com/kyleconroy/hawkthorne-journey.git
    cd hawkthorne-journey
    make run

#### OSX

1. Be sure to complete the steps above to get started
2. Install the most recent version of LÖVE - http://love2d.org
2. Open Terminal
3. Make a command line alias to love

		$ alias love='/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love'

4. Add the alias to ~/.bash_profile so it works the next time you reboot

		$ echo alias love='/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love' >> ~/.bash_profile

5. Download and install the latest version of tmx2lua

		$ curl -OL https://github.com/downloads/kyleconroy/tmx2lua/tmx2lua.osx.tar
		$ tar -xf tmx2lua.osx.tar
		$ sudo cp tmx2lua /usr/bin/tmx2lua

7. Clone your newly forked repository and change directory
	Note: You have to copy your repository url from github ( ex: https://github.com/username/hawkthorne-journey.git )

		$ git clone (your forked repository url)
		$ cd hawkthorne-journey

8. Build your maps ( this must be done each time you change a map )

		$ make maps

9. Run the game

		$ love src

	If you are testing a specific level, you can optionally pass that level name using the --level option

		$ love src --level=valley

	You can also test a specific level as a specific character

		$ love src --level=valley --character=troy

##### OpenAL Issues

Some older versions of OS X have a broken version of OpenAL. If you find the
game crashing after a few minutes of play, you'll need to download a different
version of the Love2D framework which uses OpenAL soft. You can download this
alternate version [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40773/love-0.8.0-openalsoft.zip)
